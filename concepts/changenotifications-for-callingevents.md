## Subscriptions

For more details on how subscriptions are made to Microsoft Graph, please see [Create Subscriptions](/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions).

### Subscription Resource
The following resources will be supported for subscription to call events

| Scenario                               | Resource                              | Change types |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-------------|
| Call events for a specific user | users/{userId}/communications/callevents | updated      |

### Subscription expiration

Call event subscriptions can have a max duration of a day before it expires. To prolong this subscription, a subscription update request is required. See [Update subscription](/graph/api/subscription-update) for more details. Alternatively, a new subscription may be created for the same resource property after the previous one has expired.

### Subscriptions with resource data

Subscriptions to call events only support notifications notification with resource data and will not support basic notifications. For more details about rich notifications, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data).

### Subscription payload example

```json
{
    "changeType": "updated",
    "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
    "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
    "resource": "/users/{userId}/communications/callEvents",
    "expirationDateTime": "2023-12-14T10:00:00.0000000Z",

}
```

Call event subscriptions will receive notifications when the user of interest enters or leaves applicable calling scenarios. Resource data from notifications will be included in notification payload and will need to be decrypted before it is used.
