# Get approval

Namespace: microsoft.graph

This call can be made by an approver, providing the identifier of the [access package assignment request](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md).

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
