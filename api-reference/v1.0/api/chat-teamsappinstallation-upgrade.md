# teamsAppInstallation: upgrade

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Upgrade an [app installation](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) within a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Notes**:
> - If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then effectively, the **teamsApp** installed in the meeting will get upgraded.
> - Currently, this operation does not support upgrade of apps that require resource-specific consent permissions. For details, see [Known issues](/graph/known-issues#Installation-of-apps-that-require-resource-specific-consent-permissions-is-not-supported).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
